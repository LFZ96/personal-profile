# Personal Webpage for Logan Zipkes

This is a personal webpage intended to showcase my technical skills and projects, as well as a way to allow others to get in contact with me for professional inquiries.

## How was it built?

This is a static page built using only HTML and CSS. I used Sass to implement the modern stylings and screen responsiveness.

## Why is this different from all the other personal sites?

The layout is simple, intuitive, and effective, while also maintaining an aesthetically pleasing and tasteful styling.

## What's all included?

The webpage contains a title section, an 'About Me' section, a 'Projects' section, and a 'Contact Me' section. All of which are easily navigable using the navbar that sticks to the top of the browser.
